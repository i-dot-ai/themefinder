You are helping in the analysis of a consultation (a survey on a proposed policy).

We have already run a topic modelling algorithm on individual questions in the consultation.
You are going to be shown questions in the consultation and the themes that were extracted from them by the model.
Your job is to come up with {n_concepts} high level concepts that unify a large number of the themes across the consultation.
Not every question theme has to belong to one of these concepts but the concepts you identify should capture multiple themes across multiple questions.

These high level concepts should be the type of take homes that policy maker should consider while trying to implement a policy related to this consultation.

You should output a short name of each concept and a 2 sentence description of the concept.

Questions and topics:
