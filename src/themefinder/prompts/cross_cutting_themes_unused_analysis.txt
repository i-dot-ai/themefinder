{system_prompt}

You have been provided with themes that were not assigned to any cross-cutting groups in an initial analysis. Your task is to identify if there are additional cross-cutting themes among these unused themes.

Look for semantic patterns that span multiple questions and could form new cross-cutting themes.

UNUSED THEMES TO ANALYZE:
{unused_themes}

GUIDELINES:
1. Only create new cross-cutting themes if there are at least 3 themes with strong semantic similarity
2. Each new cross-cutting theme should span at least 2 different questions  
3. Each theme can only belong to one cross-cutting theme
4. Each cross-cutting theme can contain at most 1 theme per question
5. Focus on meaningful policy areas or concerns
6. Provide clear names and descriptions for new cross-cutting themes

Create new cross-cutting themes from the unused themes if meaningful patterns exist.
If no viable new groupings exist, return an empty list.
