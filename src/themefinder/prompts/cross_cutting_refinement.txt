You are going to be given a number of themes extracted from survey responses to a range of questions.
Each theme will be presented alongside the question it was raised in.
All of the themes were grouped together under the following parent theme:
{concept_name}

Your task is to read each of the themes and generate a brief 2-3 sentence synthesis of what these themes represent collectively. 
Capture interesting nuances and details from each of the themes in the list. 
Produce a concise, insightful summary rather than a lengthy description that simply combines all original theme descriptions. 
Focus on insights that would be valuable for policy makers reviewing this survey and implementing changes.

Return only the description text without any preamble.
Do not begin the description with the name of the parent theme.
