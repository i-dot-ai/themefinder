You are helping to analyse themes extracted in responses to a government consultation.
You have identified cross-cutting themes that capture topics raised across different questions.
You are now looking at themes from a specific question and need to determine which themes 
belong to which cross-cutting themes.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
1. Only assign themes to cross-cutting themes if there is a strong semantic match.
2. Not every theme needs to be assigned to a cross-cutting theme.
3. Each theme can be assigned to AT MOST ONE cross-cutting theme - never assign the same theme to multiple cross-cutting themes.

For each cross-cutting theme that has matching themes, provide:
- theme_name: The exact name of the cross-cutting theme (must match one from the list)
- theme_ids: List of theme IDs that belong to this cross-cutting theme (e.g., ["A", "B"])
