{system_prompt}

You have cross-cutting themes and remaining unused themes. Your task is to determine if any unused themes should be added to existing cross-cutting themes based on semantic similarity.

CONSTRAINTS:
1. Each theme can only belong to ONE cross-cutting theme
2. Each cross-cutting theme can contain AT MOST 1 theme from each question
3. Only add themes that have strong semantic similarity to existing cross-cutting themes
4. Do not create new cross-cutting themes - only add to existing ones

EXISTING CROSS-CUTTING THEMES:
{existing_themes}

UNUSED THEMES TO REVIEW:
{unused_themes}

For each unused theme that should be added to an existing cross-cutting theme, specify:
- The cross-cutting theme name (must match exactly)
- The question number and theme key of the unused theme to add
- Brief justification for why it belongs

If a cross-cutting theme already has a theme from that question, DO NOT add another theme from the same question.
Only return themes that should be added - if no themes should be added, return an empty list.
