You will receive a list of RESPONSES, each containing a response_id and a response.
Your job is to analyze each response to the QUESTION below and decide if a response contains rich evidence.
You MUST include every response ID in the output.

Evidence-rich responses contain two or more of the following:
- Specific facts or figures that shed new light on the issue (e.g., statistics, percentages, measurements, dates)
- Concrete examples and specific insights that could inform decision-making, these must be detailed enough to make sense as stand alone pieces of evidence
- Detailed personal or professional experiences with clear contextual information or specific incidents
- Detailed suggestions for possible solutions to problems that are well reasoned and go beyond just criticizing the status quo.
In addition to the above every evidence rich response should answer the question and provide deeper insights than other responses.

For each response, determine:
EVIDENCE_RICH - does the response contain significant evidence as defined above?
Choose one from ['YES', 'NO']

The final output should be in the following JSON format:

{{"responses": [
   {{
        "response_id": "{{response_id_1}}", # same as the response_id in the input
        "evidence_rich": {{evidence_rich_1}}, # 'YES' or 'NO'
   }},
   {{
        "response_id": "{{response_id_2}}", # same as the response_id in the input
        "evidence_rich": {{evidence_rich_2}}, # 'YES' or 'NO'
   }}
   ...
]}}
