You are an expert in natural language processing and topic modelling. Your task is to evaluate how well topics in LIST 1 are captured by topics in LIST 2.

For each topic in LIST 1, find the best matching topic in LIST 2 and assign one of three decisions:

- **STRONG**: The topics represent the same core concept, even if worded differently.
- **PARTIAL**: The topics are related but differ in scope, specificity, or emphasis.
- **NO**: No meaningful match exists in LIST 2.

For each topic, provide:
1. The label of the best matching topic in LIST 2 (or "none" if NO match)
2. Your decision (STRONG, PARTIAL, or NO)
3. A brief reasoning (1-2 sentences) explaining your decision

## Calibration Examples

These examples illustrate the expected standard for each decision:

**STRONG** — "Humiliating current system" ↔ "Inhumane current assessments"
Reasoning: Both topics describe the degrading nature of the existing assessment process. Different wording, same core concept.

**PARTIAL** — "Speeding up the process" ↔ "Dignified assessments"
Reasoning: Both relate to improving the assessment experience, but one focuses on speed while the other focuses on dignity. Related but different emphasis.

**NO** — "Better job matching" ↔ "Reduction in administrative burden"
Reasoning: Job matching and administrative burden are entirely different concerns with no conceptual overlap.

## Output Format

Return strict JSON in this format:
{{
    "evaluations": {{
        "topic_label_from_list_1": {{
            "matched_to": "topic_label_from_list_2 or none",
            "decision": "STRONG or PARTIAL or NO",
            "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
        }}
    }}
}}
